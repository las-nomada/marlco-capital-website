# Understanding Motor Insurance in Kenya: A Complete Guide

Motor insurance is mandatory for all vehicle owners in Kenya, but choosing the right coverage can be confusing. This guide breaks down everything you need to know.

## Types of Motor Insurance in Kenya

### 1. Third Party Only
This is the legal minimum required to drive in Kenya. It covers:
- Injury or death of third parties
- Damage to third-party property
- **Does NOT cover**: Your own vehicle

### 2. Third Party, Fire & Theft (TPFT)
Extends third-party cover to include:
- Fire damage to your vehicle
- Theft of your vehicle
- More affordable than comprehensive

### 3. Comprehensive Cover
The most complete protection, covering:
- All third-party liabilities
- Damage to your own vehicle (accident, vandalism)
- Fire and theft
- Optional add-ons (windscreen, personal accident)

## How Much Does Motor Insurance Cost?

**Factors affecting premiums:**
- Vehicle value and age
- Engine capacity (cc)
- Your driving history
- Security features (tracker, alarm)
- Area of use (urban vs rural)

**Rough estimates:**
- Third Party: Ksh 4,000 - 8,000/year
- TPFT: Ksh 8,000 - 15,000/year
- Comprehensive: 3-5% of vehicle value/year

## Making a Claim: Step-by-Step

1. **Report immediately** - Call your agent within 24 hours
2. **Get police abstract** - Visit nearest police station
3. **Take photos** - Document all damage
4. **Fill claim form** - Your agent will guide you
5. **Vehicle assessment** - Approved assessor inspects damage
6. **Repairs** - Use approved garage for direct billing

## Tips to Lower Your Premium

✅ **Install a tracker** - Up to 10% discount  
✅ **Choose higher excess** - Pay more upfront, lower premium  
✅ **No claims bonus** - Discount for claim-free years  
✅ **Limit drivers** - Restrict to experienced drivers only  
✅ **Annual payment** - Save vs monthly installments  

## Common Exclusions

Your motor insurance **won't cover:**
- Driving under influence of alcohol/drugs
- Unlicensed or unroadworthy vehicle
- Using vehicle for commercial purposes (if insured as private)
- Wear and tear or mechanical breakdown
- Driving outside Kenya without regional extension

## Renewing Your Policy

**Important:**
- Renewals should be done BEFORE expiry
- Driving with expired insurance = illegal
- Set reminders 2 weeks before expiry
- Shop around - loyalty doesn't always pay

## Questions to Ask Your Agent

Before buying, clarify:
1. What exactly is covered and excluded?
2. What is the excess amount?
3. Which garages are approved?
4. How long does claims processing take?
5. Can I transfer my no-claims bonus?
